# beam-concurreny-examples
Explore Apache Beam's multi-threading and asynchronous processing capabilities with this repository. Discover practical examples and code snippets demonstrating how to leverage parallelism and concurrency in Apache Beam pipelines. 

Apache Beam is a powerful and flexible stream and batch processing model that allows you to develop data processing pipelines that are portable across various execution engines. When it comes to scaling your Apache Beam pipeline, one key aspect to consider is leveraging multithreading for improved performance.

> Scaling in Apache Beam with Multi-Threading and Asynchronous Programming

Multi-threading involves the concurrent execution of multiple threads, enabling the processing of multiple elements simultaneously. In Apache Beam, this can be achieved by leveraging the parallel processing capabilities of your pipeline.

Asynchronous Programming allows non-blocking execution of tasks, enabling the system to continue processing other tasks while waiting for certain operations to complete. This is particularly useful in scenarios where I/O operations or network calls might introduce latency.

> This repo contains three examples
  1. Api.py:  basic implementation of making API calls through API beam python
  2. Multithreaded_api.py: multi-threaded implementation of API calls through apache beam python
  3. async_api.py : asynchronous api calls through apache beam to further improve performance

To incorporate multi-threading into Apache Beam, it's essential to have a grasp of concepts like ParDo transforms and DoFn classes, along with a deep understanding of the methods provided by a DoFn class. These components play a crucial role in defining and executing parallel processing within your Apache Beam pipeline.
